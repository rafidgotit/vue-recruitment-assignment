# Frontend Developer Recruitment Test

Welcome to the recruitment test for our frontend developer position! We're excited to see your skills in action and how you approach this challenge. This test is designed to evaluate your proficiency in Nuxt 3, Vue.js, and your overall frontend development skills, including UI/UX sensibilities and attention to detail.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the base version of a Nuxt 3 project. Your task is to fork this repository, set it up locally, and make improvements to the code. We expect you to address the comments in the code, fix any bugs, and enhance the UI where needed.

### Key Technologies:

- **Nuxt 3**: A powerful framework based on Vue.js that allows you to create modern web applications.
- **Yarn**: The package manager we use for dependency management. Do not use NPM.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

First, fork this repository to your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using Yarn.

```
yarn install
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the development server using the appropriate command. 
```
yarn dev
```
This will start the server, and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Your Task

### 1. Code Improvements

- **Edit `app.vue`**: You are instructed to edit only the file named app.vue
- **Comments in Code**: Review the comments provided in the code. These comments indicate areas that need attention, such as potential bugs or areas where the UI could be improved.
- **Bug Fixes**: Identify and fix any bugs present in the code. This could be related to functionality, performance, or any errors you encounter.
- **UI Improvements**: Enhance the user interface to make it more intuitive and visually appealing. Use your creativity, but keep it user-friendly.

### 2. How to Submit

Once you've made your changes, commit them to your forked repository and push the changes to GitHub. Then, create a pull request to the original repository.

### Pull Request Instructions:

1. Navigate to the original repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
3. Select "New Pull Request."
4. Compare your forked repository's branch with the base repository.
5. Add a clear and concise title and description for your pull request.
6. Submit the pull request.

## Conclusion

You will be evaluated based on your ability to handle edge cases, your error-handling skills, your ability to fix bugs, and your UI/UX design sense. We are particularly interested in how you improve the overall user experience while maintaining clean and efficient code.
